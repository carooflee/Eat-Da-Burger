## Eat-Da-Burger

An express handlebars application that allows you to order (post) and eat (update) various types of burgers.

# Motivation

As a person who is hungry, I want to be able to place an order for any kind of burger or sandwich I can think of. I would then like to be able to eat said burger and add it to a list of devoured items in order to remember what I've eaten for later.  
    
# Installation
  `npm i`
  
  `node server.js`
  
Then launch from localhost:3000 in the browser.

# Heroku Page
   
https://arcane-thicket-25916.herokuapp.com/burgers   
    
# Usage

After loading the page, click inside the text box and enter any kind of burger or sandwich (or other food, if you'd like to annoy the back of house) that you'd like to eat. It will then be added to the list of new burgers above. When you would like to "eat" the burger, click on the 'Devour' button and the burger will be moved to the 'Devoured' list.
